自控力
## Train your willpower physiology.
by meditating, sleeping, excercising, and eating a diet.
## Forgive yourself.
too much blame will destroy the self-confidence, hence make a hopless cycle.
## Make friends with your future self.
more consistency with the future self brings better willing power
## Predict your failure.
predicting future success licenses self-indulgence today.
but prediting the possibile bad factors better prepares for them hence gives willing power
detaily, pessimism is defensive. and better if imagining in details
## Surf the urge
when the temptation comes, try to stay calm (do not follow the temptation) and not to push them away. Breathe and feel the temptation feels like on your body, like "what do hungry feels like on the body?" Just wait calmfully and breathe, surf the urge and wait for them to pass and then deminish. Try to learn wait and breathe.
